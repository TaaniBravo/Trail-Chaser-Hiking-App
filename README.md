## Description
```
An app for users to find trails nearby or by a specific location. Other criteria a user can search for includes: reviews (ex. stars), length and distance from user's location. Once a trail is chosen, the directions to the trail and the weather for the next 7 days is displayed.

The app utilizes hiking, maps, time, and weather APIs (View Resources).

## User Story
```
As a hiker
I want to find hikes based on criteria
So that I can find the best suited hike for me
```

## Our Journey
```
When presented with the acceptance criteria for our first project in this bootcamp we were given some ideas that surround COVID. This is when Bryan mentioned how it would have been nice if there was an app that sourced at home workouts. Branching off of this idea we pushed toward one of the only things you can still enjoy when in lockdown (till they closed down the parks too) and that was the awesome trails and hikes that the Pacific Northwest provides us. 

With this idea in mind we thought it would be nice if we had an app that would find your trails based on certain criteria that would help you make the right decision and not go on an adventure that you are going to regret.

After brainstorming the tangible things that we felt were accomplishable and able to be made in the time given to us were implementing the search, saving your criteria, giving you weather for the next 7 days, and a map from your location to the trail.
